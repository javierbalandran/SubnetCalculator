# SubnetCalculator
Udemy Course guided project to learn Python programming of network addressing calculation utilities

Given an IP Address and Subnet Mask by the user, the application will return 5 parameters:
1. Network Address
2. Broadcast Address
3. Number of valid hosts per subnet
4. Wildcard mask
5. Number of mask bits (CIDR notation)

The Subnet Calculator will be able to generate 2 or more random IP Addresses from the subnet in which the initial IP Address resides.
